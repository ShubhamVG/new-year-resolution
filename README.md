# New Year Resolution
Well, I made this in under 2 hours so that's great lol.
I don't wanna explain what this is but you can see it [here](https://lavisse.xyz/new-year-resolution).
Basically, I will be updating that so that y'all can see my goals and their progress.

If you wanna use it, then you need to have [dart webdev](https://dart.dev/tools/webdev) or just port the dart code to JS (ew).
You only have to edit the goals.json file BTW.

And oh, I love dart if that wasn't clear already lol.
