# New Year Resolution
## LAST UPDATE
This repo only exists so that others can fork it or understand how the CSS works.
However, it has been removed from GitHub pages. To check the live updates of the layout or my progress, visit [https://lavisse.xyz/goals/2025/](https://lavisse.xyz/goals/2025/).
I won't be changing anything from the text below except a few tad bits.

## Intro
Well, I made this in under 2 hours so that's great lol.
I don't wanna explain what this is but you can see it ~~[here](https://lavisse.xyz/new-year-resolution)~~ (not anymore; see pics below instead).
Basically, I ~~will~~ _won't_ be updating that so that y'all can see my goals and their progress.

If you wanna use it, then you need to have [dart webdev](https://dart.dev/tools/webdev) or just port the dart code to JS (ew).
You only have to edit the goals.json file BTW.

And oh, I love dart if that wasn't clear already lol.
